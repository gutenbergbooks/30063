<h1><span class="sp1">DOUBLE TAKE</span></h1>

<h2>By Richard Wilson</h2>

<p class="hd1">Illustrated by Paul Orban</p>

<p class="cap"><i><span class="dcap">Paul Asher</span>, 27, men's furnishings
buyer, leaned back and
let the cloth band be fastened across
his chest, just under his armpits. He
adjusted his heavy spectacles, closed
his eyes for a moment, breathed
deeply, and was off.</i></p>

<p>The semi-darkness was dispelled
as he shot out of a tunnel into dazzling
sunlight. The high-powered
vehicle he was driving purred
smoothly as it took the long, rising
curve. The road climbed steadily
toward the mountaintop city ahead.
He looked around to satisfy himself
that he was alone in the car.</p>

<p>He wasn't.</p>

<p>The girl was a pretty one. He'd
seen her somewhere before, he
thought. She was looking insolently
at him, her wide red mouth in a
half smile. Her dark hair stirred in
the breeze coming through the window,
next to her, which was open
just a slit.</p>

<p>She said: "Just keep going,
Sweetheart, as fast as you can."
And she patted the oversized
pocketbook that lay in her lap.</p>

<p>He pressed down on the accelerator
and the car responded with a
flow of power. The countryside fell
away from the road on either side.
Far below he could see a river,
winding broadly to the far-off sea.
The summer day sent its heat-shimmers
across the miniature landscape.</p>

<p>The road curved again. Theirs
was the only car he had seen since
he'd come out of the tunnel. But
now, far ahead, he saw another. It
was standing at the side of the road,
next to a gate that came down in
the manner of one at a railroad
crossing. But he knew by its black
and white diagonals and by the little
sentry hut half hidden behind
the other car that it marked the
frontier. A man with a rifle on his
shoulder stood there. They drew
up to it fast, but his foot automatically
eased up on the floorboard
pedal until the girl spoke sharply.</p>

<p>"Right through it, Sweetheart."</p>

<p>In the rear-view mirror he saw
her leaning forward, her face tense.</p>

<p>In a moment it would be time to
stop, if he were going to.</p>

<p><i>Paul Asher hesitated a moment.
Then he too leaned forward, the
band pressing into his chest. He
was breathing heavily. There was
an almost inaudible click.</i></p>

<p>He trod on the accelerator. He
had a glimpse of the guard unslinging
his rifle from his shoulder and
of another man running toward the
parked car as his vehicle smashed
into the flimsy gate and sent it,
cracked and splintered, to the side
of the road. He fought the slight
wrench of the wheel and sped on.
He thought he heard a shot.</p>

<p>"Nice work," the girl said. She
seemed to be appraising him as she
looked at him. "My name, incidentally,
is Naomi."</p>

<p>"Hello," he heard himself saying
as he whipped the car around a
curve that hid the frontier behind
a hill. "You seem to know who I
am."</p>

<p>"That I do," she said.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you call me by
my name, instead of 'Sweetheart'?"</p>

<p>"That's because I like you,
Sweetheart." She was looking out
the rear window. "Now just step
on the gas, because we've got company."</p>

<p>The car that had been parked
near the sentry hut was whipping
into view around the curve. It was
lighter than his, but it was fast, too.
He stepped on it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Now the road</span> had become
narrow and twisting. The
grade was steep but the surface was
good. Abruptly, it entered a forest.</p>

<p>The girl said: "Two more curves.
Then you'll see a field and a barn.
Off the road and into the barn,
fast."</p>

<p>He took the curves with rubber
screaming and almost without braking
sent the car bumping across the
field and into the barn. It was
bigger than it had seemed from the
outside. As he brought the car to
a lurching halt the barn door closed.</p>

<p>Where he had expected to see
stalls and milking machines and hay
he saw an expanse of metal floor
and monstrous machinery. The
barn door which had been a rickety
wooden slab from the outside was
a gleaming sheet of metal from the
inside. It glided silently shut and
left no joint or seam to show where
there had been an opening.</p>

<p>"Out," said Naomi.</p>

<p>As they left the car, a flexible
metal arm snaked from one of the
smooth walls, attached itself to the
front bumper of the vehicle, and
whisked it into a cubicle which
opened to receive it and closed behind
it.</p>

<p>A power-driven wheelchair sped
up to them. Sitting in it was a fat
man of middle age, with pendulous
jowls and a totally bald head. His
expression was a sardonic scowl.</p>

<p>"You have the plans?" he asked
the girl.</p>

<p>"Sweetheart here has them."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you're talking
about," the young man said.</p>

<p>"He knows, all right," the girl
said. "He pretends to be innocent,
but that is merely his training. He
has them under a sticking plaster
on the small of his back."</p>

<p>"Remove your coat and shirt,"
commanded the man in the wheelchair.</p>

<p>At that moment the floor shuddered
under their feet, a gong began
to clang insistently, and the
giant machinery, which had been
silent, throbbed into life.</p>

<p>The man in the wheelchair
whirled and was off, shouting commands
to men who materialized
high on the walls in cylindrical turrets
which the visitor could only
think of as battle stations.</p>

<p>"What <i>is</i> this place?" he asked.</p>

<p>He got no answer. Instead the
girl grabbed his arm and pulled
him off to the edge of the gigantic
metal room. An opening appeared
in the wall and she pushed him
through it into a room beyond. The
entranceway snapped shut behind
them and when he looked he could
see no door. The room also was
windowless.</p>

<p>Naomi went to a metal table and
as she looked down into its surface
it became a screen. Mirrored in it
was the mountainous countryside
they had driven through to get to
the barn&mdash;or what had seemed to
be a barn from the outside. He
looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>They saw as from a height. There
was the light car that had chased
them from the frontier. Standing
near it was a man in an officer's
uniform and another in civilian
clothes. They were talking and
gesturing. Beside the car was a
tank. As they watched, its gun fired
and the structure they were in
shuddered, but they heard no
sound.</p>

<p>Lumbering up the mountain road
were more tanks and a self-propelled
gun. One of the tanks became
enveloped in smoke and flames as
they watched. After a moment the
smoke cleared. The tank was gone;
where it had been there was a deep
crater.</p>

<p>Gradually, the figures in the
drama below grew smaller. At the
same time the vista widened, so
that they saw more and more
countryside. It twisted beneath
them and the horizon came giddily
into view. A few moments later
the curvature of the earth could be
plainly seen.</p>

<p>Everything fitted together at
once. Some of the things, anyway.</p>

<p>"We're in a ship," he said. "Some
kind of rocket-ship."</p>

<p>"It's a planet plane," the girl
said. "We're safe now."</p>

<p>"Safe from what?" he asked.
"What's this all about?"</p>

<p>She smiled enigmatically. "Hafitz
could tell you, if he chose. He's
the boss."</p>

<p>"The man in the wheelchair?"</p>

<p>She nodded and took out a compact.
As she added lipstick to her
mouth, she looked him over, between
glances in her mirror.</p>

<p>"You don't look like the spy type.
If there is a type."</p>

<p>"I'm not a spy. I don't know
what you're talking about."</p>

<p>"The innocent! Go on, take off
your coat and shirt. We'll save
Hafitz some time."</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to, just to prove this
is all ridiculous. A case of mistaken
identity. You've made a mistake,
that's what you've done."</p>

<p>He stood there, hesitating.</p>

<p>The girl gave a burst of laughter.
Then she said: "All right, Sweetheart.
I'll turn my back."</p>

<p>She did, and he pulled his shirt
out of his trousers. Then he froze.
Taped to the skin of his back was
a flat package.</p>

<p><i>Paul Asher made the decision. He
bent forward, feeling perspiration
in the palms of his hands. There
was a faint click.</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Quickly</span> he ripped the adhesive
from his back. There
was an instant of pain as the plaster
came free. He wadded up the
sticky package, dropped it to the
floor and kicked it under the desk.</p>

<p>Then he took off his coat, tie
and shirt.</p>

<p>"You can turn around now," he
said.</p>

<p>"A more modest spy I've never
seen. Okay," she said, "now <i>you</i>
turn around."</p>

<p>"As you see," he said, "there are
no plans&mdash;no papers."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not now. But there is a
red mark on your back. What is
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he said. "Oh&mdash;that's a
birthmark."</p>

<p>She spun him around to face her.
Her face was harsh. She slapped
his cheek. "Where is the sticking
plaster? Don't trifle with me."</p>

<p>Her eyes bored into his. He returned
the gaze, then shrugged.</p>

<p>"Under the desk," he said. "I
tore it off and kicked it under the
desk."</p>

<p>"You are sensible to confess," she
said.</p>

<p>She bent down, unwisely.</p>

<p><i>Paul Asher felt the familiar
tightening in his chest as he leaned
forward. The click was barely
heard.</i></p>

<p>He raised his hand and brought
the edge of it down hard on the
back of her neck.</p>

<p>She crumpled and fell to the
metal floor. He noticed that a smear
of her freshly-applied lipstick came
off on it.</p>

<p>He pushed the unconscious body
aside and fished the packet out
from under the desk. He searched
the room for another hiding place.</p>

<p>But it was too late. A section of
wall opened and Hafitz, the fat man
in the wheelchair, sped in.</p>

<p>He wheeled past the young man,
looked briefly at the unconscious
girl, then whisked himself around.</p>

<p>"You will pay for this, my
friend," he said. "But first we will
have the plans for the way-station.
Where are they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about
any plans and I don't know anything
about a way-station. I tried
to tell the girl: it's all a crazy mistake."</p>

<p>"We will see," said Hafitz. He
pressed a button on the arm of his
wheelchair and two bruisers appeared
through the walls, in the
abrupt way people had of materializing
here. Bruisers was the only
way they could be described. They
were human brutes, all muscle and
malevolence.</p>

<p>"Take them," said Hafitz, indicating
the unconscious girl and the
young man. "Take them and search
them for a small packet. If you do
not find it, search this room. If you
do not find it still, hurt the male
animal. They persuade well with
pain here, I understand. But do
not kill him. I will be in the communications
room."</p>

<p>He sped off, through a wall opening.</p>

<p>One of the bruisers picked up the
girl, roughly, and disappeared with
her. The other grabbed the young
man and hauled him off in a third
direction. The young man hastily
snatched up his coat, shirt and tie
en route.</p>

<p>They ended up in a cell of a
room, about seven feet in all directions,
in which the bruiser
stripped him, methodically went
through each piece of clothing,
and then satisfied himself that
he didn't have the packet anywhere
on his body.</p>

<p>The muscle-man then raised a
fist.</p>

<p>"Wait," his prospective victim
said. He thought back quickly.
"Hafitz didn't say you could bat me
around till you searched the room,
too."</p>

<p>The other spoke for the first time.
"You say the truth." He put his
arm down.</p>

<p>The young man watched intently
as the bruiser went through the wall
of the cell-like room.</p>

<p>He dressed fast. By placing his
fingers in exactly the same position
as the other had done, was able to
make the wall open for him.</p>

<p>The silver-metal corridor had
two directions. He went to the right.
After many turnings, at each of
which he reconnoitered carefully,
he came to a passageway that was
damp. Why it was damp he couldn't
tell, but there in the wetness
were tracks which could have been
made by a wheelchair.</p>

<p>He followed them, feeling the
throb of giant engines underfoot.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The wheelchair</span> tracks
abruptly made a ninety-degree
turn and ended at a blank wall.
Somewhere beyond it must be the
communications room.</p>

<p>He retreated and waited.</p>

<p>In time the wall snapped open
and Hafitz sped out. The young
man retreated into the maze of corridors
and hoped chance would be
on his side. It was. Hafitz went another
way.</p>

<p>The young man ran back to the
wall and used his fingers on it in
the combination he had learned. It
opened for him.</p>

<p>He closed it behind him and
blinked at the huge instrument
panel which filled almost the entire
room.</p>

<p>One of the instruments was a
color vision screen, tuned in to a
room in which there was a mahogany
desk, at which was seated a
man in uniform. Behind him was
a map of the United States.</p>

<p>The man in uniform was a major
general in the Air Force. An aide,
a lieutenant colonel, was leaning
over the desk. He had a sheaf of
papers in his hand. The men's conversation
was audible.</p>

<p>"Messages have been coming in
from all over Europe," the colonel
was saying. "Here's the way it reconstructs:</p>

<p>"Our agent was en route to the
rendezvous when he was intercepted
by Naomi. That's the only name
we have for her. She's a spy. She's
worked for half a dozen countries
and her present employer could be
any one of them. They were spotted
as they crossed the frontier between
Italy and France. Their car
went into a barn and we thought
we had them. But the barn turned
out to be a spaceship in disguise. It
took off."</p>

<p><i>So I'm their agent, Paul Asher
thought. So that's what it's all
about. I'm a secret agent for the
United States, but they didn't tell
me anything about it. This is real
George, this is ... He expected to
hear a faint click and leaned forward
experimentally, but nothing
happened. He leaned backward.
Still nothing.</i></p>

<p>The colonel was answering a
question from the general. "We
don't know who they are, Sir. They're
not from Earth, obviously. And
the best scientific minds go still
further&mdash;they're not even from our
solar system. Whoever they are, it's
clear that they don't want us to
build a way-station in space."</p>

<p>"Those spaceships started buzzing
around right after our first
Moon trip," the general said. "This
is the first time they've become
really troublesome&mdash;now that we've
got the Moon under control and are
ready to build the way-station so
we can get to Mars."</p>

<p>"That's right, Sir," said the
colonel.</p>

<p>"Progress is a wonderful thing,"
said the general. "Things certainly
have changed since those early days
of strategic atomic bombing and
guided missile experiments."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir," said the colonel.</p>

<p>The young man in the communications
room of the spaceship let
his attention wander away from the
scene back on Earth and experimented
with some of the switches
and controls. Trial and error led
him to one which lit up a signal on
the desk of the general.</p>

<p>The general flicked it on.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said. He looked puzzled
when he got no picture, just a
voice saying, "Hello, hello."</p>

<p>"Yes?" he said. "Hello. Speak
up, man."</p>

<p>"This is your agent aboard the
enemy spaceship," said the young
man. "Do you read me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the general. "We
read you. Go ahead."</p>

<p>"I may not have much time. Get
a fix on me if you can. And send
help."</p>

<p>"What's your position?" the general
was reacting well. He was alert
and all business.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I've been taken
prisoner, but I'm temporarily free.
There isn't much time. Hafitz is
bound to be back soon. He seems
to be the brains of this outfit&mdash;this
part of the outfit, anyway. Naomi
is here, too, but I don't know
whether she's with them or against
them."</p>

<p>"Where are the plans, son?"
asked the general.</p>

<p>"They're safe, for the moment. I
can't guarantee for how long."</p>

<p>"I'm getting the fix," the colonel
said. He was beyond the range of
the young man's vision screen. "I've
got him. He's still within range,
but accelerating fast. We can intercept
if we get up a rocket soon
enough."</p>

<p>"Get it up," ordered the general.
"Get up a squadron. Scramble the
Moon patrol and send out reserves
from Earth at once."</p>

<p>"Right!" said the colonel.</p>

<p>The young man was so engrossed
in the makings of his rescue party
that he didn't see the wall open up
behind him.</p>

<p>There was a squeak of rubber
tires and he whirled to see Hafitz,
in his wheelchair, slamming toward
him. The fat man's hand held a
weird-looking gun.</p>

<p>The young man recoiled. His
back pushed against a row of control
buttons.</p>

<p><i>Then everything went white.</i></p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Paul Asher</span> blinked his eyes,
like a man awakening from a
vivid dream.</p>

<p>The house lights went on and the
manager of the theater came on the
stage. He stood in front of the
blank master screen with its checkerboard
pattern of smaller screens,
on which the several lines of action
had taken place simultaneously.
Paul took off his selectorscope spectacles
with the earphone attachments.</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," the
manager said. "I regret very much
having to announce that this vicarion
of the production <i>Spies from
Space</i> was defective. The multifilm
has broken and, because of the
complexity of the vikie process, it
will be impossible to splice it without
returning it to the laboratory.</p>

<p>"Ushers are at the exits with
passes good for any future performance.
Those of you who prefer can
exchange them at the box office
for a full refund of your admission
price."</p>

<p>Paul Asher unstrapped the wired
canvas band from across his
chest. He put the selectorscope
spectacles into the pouch on the
arm of the seat and walked out of
the R.K.O. Vicarion into High
Street and around the corner to
where his car was parked.</p>

<p>His roommate at the communapt,
MacCloy, was still up when he got
there, going over some projectos.
Mac snapped off the screen and
quickly swept the slides together
and into a case.</p>

<p>"You're back early," MacCloy
said.</p>

<p>"The multifilm broke," Paul
told him.</p>

<p>"Oh." Mac seemed abstracted, as
he often did, and again Paul wondered
about this man he knew so
casually and who had never confided
in him about anything&mdash;especially
about his government job.</p>

<p>"So I missed the ending," Paul
said. "I guess it was near the end,
anyhow. The space patrol was on
the way, but the villain, that Hafitz,
was just about to blast me with his
gun and I don't know how I would
have got out of that."</p>

<p>"I remember that," Mac said. He
laughed. "You must have been
Positive all the way through. Like
I was when I saw it. If you'd had
any negative reactions&mdash;if you'd
leaned back against the strap instead
of forward&mdash;you'd have been
at some other point in the multiplot
and I wouldn't have recognized
that part. Want me to tell you
how it ends?"</p>

<p>"Go ahead. Then if I do see it
again I'll change the ending somewhere
along the line with a lean-back."</p>

<p>"Okay. There really wasn't
much more. It takes so much film
to provide all the plot choices that
they can't make them very long.</p>

<p>"Well, Hafitz blasts me and
misses," Mac went on, "&mdash;or blasts
<i>you</i> and misses, to keep it in your
viewpoint. When you jump back,
you set off a bunch of controls.
That was the control room, too,
not just the communications room.
Well, those controls you lean back
against take the ship out of automatic
pilot and send it into some
wild acrobatics and that's why Hafitz
misses. Also it knocks him out
of the wheelchair so he's helpless
and you get his gun. Also you see
that the plans are still there&mdash;right
where you put them, stuck to the
bottom of his wheelchair."</p>

<p>"So that was it," said Paul.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mac. "And then you
cover Hafitz while he straightens
out the ship and you rendezvous
with the space control and they take
you all into custody. You get a citation
from the government. That's
about it. Corny, huh?"</p>

<p>"But what about the girl?" Paul
asked. "Is she really a spy?"</p>

<p>"Girl? What girl?"</p>

<p>"Naomi, her name was," Paul
said. "You couldn't miss her. She
was in the vikie right at the beginning&mdash;that
brunette in the fast
car."</p>

<p>"But there wasn't any girl, Paul,"
Mac insisted. "Not when I saw it."</p>

<p>"Of course there was. There had
to be&mdash;the vikies all start out the
same way, no matter who sees
them."</p>

<p>"It beats me, pal. I know I didn't
see her. Maybe you dreamed up
the dame."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," Paul said.
"But of course it's possible." He
yawned. "I wouldn't mind dreaming
of her tonight, at that. Think
I'll turn in now, Mac. I've got that
long trip tomorrow, you know. Up
to Canada to look over a new line
of Marswool sport jackets at the
All-Planets Showroom."</p>

<p>"Driving or flying?"</p>

<p>"The weather prognosis is zero-zero.
I'll drive."</p>

<p>"Good," said Mac.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Paul Asher</span> woke up late. He
had a confused recollection of
a dream. Something about a beautiful
brunette giving him a backrub.</p>

<p>A look at the chrono sent the
dream out of his head and he hurried
through shaving and dressing.</p>

<p>His car was waiting for him, engine
idling, at the curb. He got in,
tossing his briefcase and topcoat
ahead of him to the far side of the
front seat. His back began to itch,
insistently, and he rubbed it against
the leather upholstery.</p>

<p>Paul adjusted the safety belt
around him, and fastened it. Might
as well do it now, instead of having
to fool around with it later.
Damn that itch, anyway! It was as
if something were stuck to his skin&mdash;like
a sticking plaster....</p>

<p>The high-powered vehicle purred
smoothly as it took a long, rising
curve. The road climbed steadily
toward the mountaintop city ahead.</p>

<p>The scene was familiar.</p>

<p>The itching of his back spread
and became a prickly feeling in the
small hairs at the nape of his neck.</p>

<p>He knew now that he was not
alone in the car. He looked in the
rear-view mirror.</p>

<p>Naomi.</p>

<p>She was looking at him insolently,
her wide red mouth in a half smile.</p>

<p>She said: "Just keep going,
Sweetheart, as fast as you can."</p>
